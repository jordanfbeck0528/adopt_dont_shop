 An option appears to submit the application, after
 filling out an "Applicant Description" form
 if i fill out the description form,
 then click submit, updating the applicant
 status to pending, and updating that
 description_of_applicant in the application object,
 then redirecting to the application to the show view,
 and reflecting that change in the browser
 <% end %>

 <% unless @application.pets.empty? %>
  <%= form_with(url: "/applications/#{@application.id}", method: "patch", local: true) do |f| %>
  <h5><%= f.label "Enter Description of Applicant" %></h5><br>
    <p><%= f.text_area :message, size: "70x5" %></p><br>
    <p><%= f.submit "Adopt this pet" %></p>

 As a visitor
When I visit an application's show page
And I have added one or more pets to the application
Then I see a section to submit my application
And in that section I see an input to enter why I would make a good owner for these pet(s)
When I fill in that input
And I click a button to submit this application
Then I am taken back to the application's show page
And I see an indicator that the application is "Pending"
And I see all the pets that I want to adopt
And I do not see a section to add more pets to this application

<%= f.label :description_of_applicant %>
<%= f.text_field :description_of_applicant %>

Approving a Pet for Adoption

As a visitor
When I visit an admin application show page
('/admin/applications/:id')
For every pet that the application is for,
I see a button to approve the application for
that specific pet
When I click that button
Then I'm taken back to the admin application
show page And next to the pet that I approved,
I do not see a button to approve this pet
And instead I see an indicator next to the
pet that they have been approved
